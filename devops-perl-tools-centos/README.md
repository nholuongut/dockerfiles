# Hadoop, Hive, Solr, NoSQL, Web, Linux Tools ###

A few of the Hadoop, NoSQL, Web & Linux tools I've written over the years. All programs have --help to list the available options.

See a list of included programs with descriptions on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/nholuongut/DevOps-Perl-tools#a-sample-of-cool-programs-in-this-toolbox).

Running the docker container without arguments will show just the list of programs:

```
docker run nholuongut/perl-tools
```

Run any given program:

```
docker run nholuongut/perl-tools <program> <args>
```

Related Docker images can be found for many Open Source, Big Data and NoSQL technologies on [my DockerHub profile](https://hub.docker.com/r/nholuongut).
The source for them all can be found in the [master Dockerfiles GitHub repo](https://github.com/nholuongut/Dockerfiles/).
