# Hadoop, Spark / PySpark, HBase, Pig, Ambari, IPython and Linux Tools ###

A few of the Hadoop, Spark & Linux tools I've written over the years.

See a list of included programs with descriptions on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/nholuongut/DevOps-Python-tools#pytools).

Running the docker container without arguments will show just the list of programs:

```
docker run nholuongut/pytools
```

Run any given program:

```
docker run nholuongut/pytools <program> <args>
```

Related Docker images can be found for many Open Source, Big Data and NoSQL technologies on [my DockerHub profile](https://hub.docker.com/r/nholuongut).
The source for them all can be found in the [master Dockerfiles GitHub repo](https://github.com/nholuongut/Dockerfiles/).
